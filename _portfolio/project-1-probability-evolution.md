## Project Overview

To uncover the underlying driving field of time series data, we trained deep networks using constraints adapted to the Hamilton-Jacobian method to find the critical subspace and evolution field functions, bridging high-dimensional experimental data and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.

**Duration**: 2024-2025

**Supervisor**: Prof. Jin Wang (State University of New York, Stony Brook)
