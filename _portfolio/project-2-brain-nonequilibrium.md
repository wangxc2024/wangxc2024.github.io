## Project Overview

To uncover the quantitative rules underlying brain network dynamics and provide a physical picture of how such complex systems operate efficiently, we apply methods from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics through modeling across levels from single neurons to multiple cortical areas, providing predictive indicators and quantitative relations.
